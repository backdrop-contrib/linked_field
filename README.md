# Linked Field

Linked Field allows you to link fields in the field formatter settings. E.g. you
have a content type teaser with an image and a link field and you want to link
the image to the entered link.

You can either select a field to be used for destination or simply enter a
token. HTML attributes are supported for the generated link as well.

## Dependencies

None. However, you may wish to install the Entity Tokens module:

 - when using Link fields, to access the link title and URL.
 - when you are searching for Field Collection tokens.

# Installation and Usage

- Install this module using the [official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules)
